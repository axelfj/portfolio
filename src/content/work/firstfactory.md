As a Jr Software Engineer, I worked under contract for ROC Capital and then got transferred to S&P Global due to staff-cutting, consequence of Covid hitting globally.
For this period of time, I was working under two clients contracts, which helped me developed a wider perspective needed to solve different tasks related to Software, which guidance from more experience peers as Sr Software Engineers and Tech Leads, I started introducing my code into production.
Got promoted after one year as a Jr and as a Software Engineer, I worked under contract for S&P Global.
Under my manager suggestions, I did develop a little project in MERN stack.

- Built an PDF report as a first task ever for production environment, and delivered carefully for the client. Translated seamlessly into another client with another whole stack, in a matter of 2 months.
- Built an application (while transitioning) for the company that would help track hours worked by employee.
- Solved a bug that reproduced across the whole application, which resulted in me having ownership of the fix and having to validate and fix each page having the bug, this lasted for 6 months.
- Migrated XML pages to React in order to innovate the webpage, using table libraries to display information.
