As a Application Developer, I worked in the AIOps team. This team is in charge of manage a large volume of data, by implementing API REST backend services, I ensured the transmition of the data through the different cloud environments, as well as recollecting insights and manage traditional and cloud infrastructure.

- Took complete ownership of building a whole API REST application, in less time than promised (less than a quarter) I was looking already at 80% completion, providing a quicker solution to the application insights.
