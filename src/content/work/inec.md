Finishing my career, I entered this project with two peers. 
The objective was to build a system that could store information through forms, asking a series of questions, to make sure the national enterprises (in Costa Rica) were following some norms.
Each question could have weight, some questions would have more weight than others, making it a great way of researching how to implement this in the application.

- In the scope of 6 months, we went from gathering requirements to deployment.
- By doing meetings every 15 days, we assured high quality, correct storage and proper display of the application.
