As a Software Engineer II, I worked closely with another set of engineers, a Senior Engineer, a Tech Lead and a Manager. Together we discussed with a Project Manager the business needs and followed every agile ceremony to tackle all the features needed.
For every feature that the team developed, it needed to go through all the SDLC (Requirements, Design, Implementation (Coding), Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance). Each team had a QA assigned and we, as engineers created the tests cases in order to the QA to execute them, and proceed with deployment.

- Migrated the old Kareo color schema to the new Tebra color schema in the span of a quarter. Working closely with other teams in order to align with the company's vision for the webpage.
- Migrated a complete Stored Procedure logic into different services in Java, and connected them through APIs, which reduced costs for accesing the database so often through the SP.
